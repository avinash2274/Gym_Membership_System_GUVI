## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements & Local Setup

This section provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### I. System Requirements

#### Minimum Requirements:
* **Web Browser:** A modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+).
    * Google Chrome (version 80+)
    * Mozilla Firefox (version 78+)
    * Microsoft Edge (version 88+)
    * Safari (version 14+)
* **Code Editor:** Any plain text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for viewing or modifying the code.
    * VS Code (Recommended)
    * Sublime Text
    * Atom
    * Notepad++

#### For Backend Development (Contact Form):
* **Node.js & npm:** If you plan to set up a Node.js backend, you will need Node.js (version 14.x or higher) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

### II. Local Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

#### Step 1: Get the Project Files
You can either download the project as a ZIP file or clone it using Git.

* **Option A: Download ZIP**
    1.  Download the project source code as a ZIP file.
    2.  Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

* **Option B: Clone with Git (Recommended)**
    1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
    2.  Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
        ```
    3.  Navigate into the newly created project directory:
        ```bash
        cd your-repository-name
        ```

#### Step 2: Running the Frontend
The frontend of this project is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, so it does not require a build step or a complex server.

1.  Navigate to the project folder where you extracted or cloned the files.
2.  Locate the `index.html` file.
3.  **Right-click** on `index.html` and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser.

Alternatively, for a better development experience with features like live-reloading, you can use a simple local server. If you have VS Code, the **Live Server** extension is an excellent option.

### III. Backend Configuration (for Contact Form)
The contact form needs a backend service to process the form data and send an email. The frontend is already set up to send a request, but you need to point it to a functional backend endpoint.

#### Option 1: Using a Third-Party Service (EmailJS - Easiest)
1.  **Create an Account:** Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create a free account.
2.  **Add an Email Service:** Connect your email provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).
3.  **Create an Email Template:** Design the email template that will be sent to you when a user submits the form. You can use variables like `{{from_name}}`, `{{from_email}}`, and `{{message}}` to include the form data.
4.  **Update JavaScript:** In your project's JavaScript file, replace the form submission logic with the EmailJS SDK. You will need to add your `serviceID`, `templateID`, and `userID` from your EmailJS dashboard.

#### Option 2: Setting up a Node.js Backend (Advanced)
If you prefer to run your own backend:
1.  **Initialize a Node.js project:**
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
2.  **Install necessary packages:** You'll need a framework like Express to create the server and a library like Nodemailer to send emails.
    ```bash
    npm install express nodemailer cors
    ```
3.  **Create a server file** (e.g., `server.js`) and set up an endpoint (e.g., `/send-email`) that accepts POST requests from your contact form.
4.  **Use Nodemailer** within this endpoint to configure your email service provider (e.g., Gmail with an "App Password") and send the email containing the form data.
5.  **Update the `fetch` URL** in your frontend JavaScript to point to your local server's endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/send-email`).
